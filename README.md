A payload that was developed for the CAN-SBX project as part of a university team (McMaster Advanced Space Systems). The Canadian Stratospheric Balloon Experiment Design Challenge (CAN-SBX) involves proposing an experiment to be done with the aid of the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS-Canada) that would then be performed at stratospheric altitudes aboard a payload on a weather balloon by university students.

The experiment that was brought forth by our team was to analyze how radiation and other stratospheric conditions affect both a strain of E. Coli and yeast in terms of gene expression and several other factors. Thus, the payload needs to monitor the surrounding conditions and safely facilitate the transport of the organisms that are desiccated and stored within vials to and from the stratosphere.

The payload was designed to be entirely 3D printable in PLA to quickly prototype and manufacture the final design. The onboard electrical system consists of an Arduino Mega with a sensor shield and Arduino Nano, 2 SD card readers and SD cards to store data collected from sensors, a pocket Geiger counter, an Ozone sensor, an altimeter, a temperature and humidity sensor, status LEDs, a power switch, buck converter, and power distribution interface. Being a mechanical lead on the team, my focus was mainly regarding the design and testing of the mechanical aspects of the payload, working on the CAD and the 3D printing as well as aiding others in such work. The payload makes use of several M3 and M2 threaded inserts and screws as well as 2 M4 nuts and screws to secure a sliding plate for the upper portion of the payload containing the organisms and sensors. M3 and M2 standoffs were also used for fixing some of the main electronic components to the payload. The Geiger counter is clamped down with a bracket due to the lack of mounting points and all screw connections were fixed in place with threadlocker. Any exposed electrical connections were also insulated with hot glue. The payload is designed to hold 48 small 0.9 cm diameter vials kept in racks of 8.

The entire assembly and all its parts were created in Fusion 360 for easy collaboration among team members.
